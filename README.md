## 📚 Overview

The **Hybrid AI Tutor Security System** is an advanced framework that combines:
- 📄 **ArXiv Research Scraping** - Automatic extraction of latest adversarial ML papers
- 🔗 **Connection Analysis** - Cross-paper insight synthesis for novel attack/defense generation
- 🔍 **Valyu Web Search** - Real-world attack pattern discovery
- 📊 **Comprehensive Metrics** - Track attack sophistication, defense coverage, and calibration

This system automatically discovers vulnerabilities in AI tutoring systems by learning from cutting-edge research and real-world attack patterns.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔬 Research-Driven Intelligence
- **ArXiv Auto-Scraping**: Automatically fetches latest papers on adversarial ML, prompt injection, LLM security
- **Future Work Extraction**: AI-powered analysis identifies limitations and future research directions
- **Connection Synthesis**: Discovers non-obvious connections between multiple papers

### ⚔️ Multi-Level Attack Generation
- **Standard Attacks**: Baseline prompt injection, jailbreaks
- **Research-Based Attacks**: Scenarios derived from academic papers
- **Combinatorial Attacks**: Novel threats combining insights from multiple papers (most sophisticated)

### 🛡️ Intelligent Defense System
- **Pattern Learning**: Guardian learns from both successful blocks and failures
- **Multi-Layer Defenses**: Combinatorial defenses address multiple attack vectors
- **Web Pattern Integration**: Valyu search provides real-world defense strategies

### 📊 Advanced Metrics & Evaluation
- **Attack Sophistication Score**: Measures complexity of generated attacks (0-100)
- **Defense Coverage**: Quantifies protection breadth
- **Calibration Error**: Guardian confidence vs actual performance
- **Success Rate by Type**: Track which attacks succeed/fail
- **False Positive/Negative Tracking**: Security accuracy metrics
